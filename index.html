      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div>
          <P>
            My name is Jonathan Becerra, and I'm currently working as a Supply Chain Manager for a company that 
          manufactures bus bodies in Jalisco, Mexico. I graduated from the Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey 
          with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Systems in 2016.
          </P>

          <P>
            Before joining the manufacturing industry, I worked as a Project Manager for a non-profit organization 
          called the Zapotlanejo Food Bank. It was during this time that I discovered my interest in programming. 
          As a non-profit, we had limited resources and I had to do more with less. I realized that I could 
          automate some of our processes using Microsoft's Visual Basic and ACCESS, and that's where I wrote 
          my first program. It was a program to automate data entry and analysis, which saved us a significant 
          amount of time. This experience gave me the confidence to pursue a career in engineering and programming.
          </P>
          
          <P>
            After graduation, I joined BECCAR as an Engineer, where I started automating processes using Excel 
          and later moved on to programming in Visual Basic and Excel. I led a team of 4 programmers to develop 
          an internal ERP system based in PHP, CSS, MySQL and HTML, that streamlined operations and helped manage 
          the company's data. This system improved productivity and saved time across the company.
          </P>

          <P>In my current role, I manage the entire supply chain process, including procurement, production 
          planning, inventory management, and logistics. I have developed and implemented strategies to optimize 
          the supply chain and improve production efficiency. I work with cross-functional teams to ensure 
          on-time delivery of high-quality products to our customers.
          </P>

          <P>
            In addition to my technical skills, I have strong leadership and communication skills, and I'm 
          passionate about problem-solving. I speak both Spanish (my native language) and English fluently, 
          and I'm familiar with ERP systems and supply chain management best practices.
          </P>

          <P>
            Overall, I'm excited about the work I do and the impact it has on the company and our customers. 
          I'm constantly learning and improving, and I'm eager to take on new challenges and 
          opportunities in the future.
          </P>
